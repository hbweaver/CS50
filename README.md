# CS50 Web Development Project

This is my first webpage using the HTML markup and CSS style sheet languages for an assignment in Harvard University's 
CS for Business Professionals. It serves to express gratitude for the concepts learned and provide course content to those interested. If there are any recommendations to the HTML and CSS syntax, please do not refrain from constructive criticism - it will be an ongoing project and become more interactive as new concepts are learned.
