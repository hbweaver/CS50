# CS50 Web Development Project

This is my first webpage using the HTML markup and CSS style sheet languages for an assignment in Harvard University's 
CS for Business Professionals. It serves to express gratitude for the concepts learned and provide course content to those inteserested. If there are any recommendations to the HTML and CSS syntax, please do not refrain from constructive criticism - it will be an ongoing project and become more interactive as new concepts are learned.

## Main Goals of Project

* Learning the basic structure of HTML markup:
  * elements: headers, body, paragraphs, etc.
  * attributes: links, images, sources, width, height, style, and title
  * sizing headers
  * block and inline elements
  * classes and id's
  * forms
  
* Getting comfortable with implementing CSS:
  * keeping it DRY
  * intuitive readability
  * shorthand
  
* Implementing Python via Flask:
  * using the microweb framework flask for routing
