    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>
        Welcome to my first webpage written with HTML and CSS for an assignment in
        <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/computer-science-business-professionals">Harvard
            University's Computer Science for Business Professionals</a>. This preliminary webpage serves as a token
        of appreciation to the CS50 staff and is targeted towards those interested in learning more about the
        course. Anyone interested in the course can find some of the lectures as well as other curated CS50 content
        on this page.
    </p>

    <h3>GRATITUDE</h3>
    <p>
        Before commencing this course I was unfamiliar with many concepts in computer science. However, the top-down
        nature and pedagogy has made certain principles easily understandable. These topics included cloud
        computing, networking, privacy, scalability, security, and more. Detailed algorithmic processes were
        emphasized alongside time and space complexities - wherein trade-offs and optimization scenarios are
        explained. The course structure was a big help into being able to grasp what used to be challenging,
        abstract ideas and I can say with full confidence I have learned more useful information in this class than
        most other.
    </p>

    <p>
        A big thank you to Dr. David J. Malan and his wonderful teaching assistants for all of their hard work
        in both the preparation and delivery. The breadth of the topics covered are succint and extremely practical.
        The passion they exude for the subject is evident in every lesson and the feedback in submissions have been
        extremely helpful.
    </p>

    <p>
        After progressing through the course content — computational thinking, programming
        languages, internet technologies, and web development not least among them — my journey into computer
        science is only getting started. I'm excited to say the least, as the utility for such skills will
        undoubtedly be a springboard into additional opportunities for future endeavors and a way of
        expressing some creativity while having fun. Thanks again.
    </p>

    <h3>LECTURES</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned above, these lessons are pertinent to anyone wanting to grasp introductory concepts to computer
        science. Brian Yu's melodic rendition of the CS50 introduction in the first video most likely sums up the
        emotions of anyone who has had the privelage of learning the material. It hasn't been easy but the
        journey has been exciting nonetheless. Feel free to cue the intro and watch the lectures alongside a
        supplementary podcast below:
